# Robotics-Final
For the 2023-2024 school year, a final project for robotics course was constructed. The final project consisted on creating a dual-axis solar panel, that rotated in the direction of the sunlight. The purpose of this design was to maximize the amount of sunlight intake of the solar panel due to the positioning of the sun changing throughout the day. The prototype was constructed using cardboard, mini solar panels, servos, an arduino mini, breadboard and resistors and wires as needed. The breadboard has LEDs that will light up depending on the intake of sunlight as a way of troubleshooting the device. 

The project was assembled and coded in Arduino IDE using C/C++ and presented amongst peers to be graded.
